tag	Utopia
description	Natural and social conditions on this world have made it a paradise for its inhabitants, a genuine utopia of happiness and fulfillment. This is normally the result of drastic human engineering, including brain-gelding, neurochemical control, personality curbs, or complete “humanity” redefinitions. Even so, the natives are extremely happy with their lot, and may wish to extend that joy to poor, sad outsiders.

tag	Prison Planet
description	This planet is or was intended as a prison. Some such prisons were meant for specific malefactors of the Terran Mandate, while others were to contain entire “dangerous” ethnic groups or alien races. Some may still have warden AIs or automatic systems to prevent any unauthorized person from leaving, and any authorization permits have long since expired.
enemies	Crazed warden AI, Brutal heir to gang leadership, Offworlder who’s somehow acquired warden powers and exploits the locals
friends	Innocent local born here, Native technician forced to maintain the very tech that imprisons them, Offworlder trapped here by accident
complications	Departure permits are a precious currency, The prison industry still makes valuable pretech devices, Gangs have metamorphosed into governments, The local nobility descended from the prison staff
things	A pass to get offworld, A key to bypass ancient security devices, Contraband forbidden by the security scanners
places	Mandate-era prison block converted to government building, Industrial facility manned by mandatory numbers of prisoners, Makeshift shop where contraband is assembled

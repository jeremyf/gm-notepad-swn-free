tag	Former Warriors
description	The locals of this world were once famed for their martial prowess. They may have simply had a very militaristic culture, or were genetically engineered for combat, or developed high-tech weaponry, or had brilliant leadership. Those days are past, however, either due to crushing defeat, external restrictions, or a cultural turn toward peace.
enemies	Unreformed warlord leader, Bitter mercenary chief, Victim of their warfare seeking revenge
friends	Partisan of the new peaceful ways, Outsider desperate for military aid, Martial genius repressed by the new dispensation
complications	Neighboring worlds want them pacified or dead, They only ever used their arts in self-defense, The source of their gifts has been “turned off” in a reversible way
things	War trophy taken from a defeated foe, Key to re-activating their martial ways, Secret cache of high-tech military gear
places	Cemetery of dead heroes, Memorial hall now left to dust and silence, Monument plaza dedicated to the new culture

tag	Cybercommunists
description	On this world communism actually works, thanks to pretech computing devices and greater or lesser amounts of psychic precognition. Central planning nodes direct all production and employment on the world. Citizens in good standing have access to ample amounts of material goods for all needs and many wants. Instead of strife over wealth, conflicts erupt over political controls, cultural precepts, or control over the planning nodes. Many cybercommunist worlds show a considerable bias toward the private interests of those who run the planning nodes.

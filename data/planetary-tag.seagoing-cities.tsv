tag	Seagoing Cities
description	Either the world is entirely water or else the land is simply too dangerous for most humans. Human settlement on this world consists of a number of floating cities that follow the currents and the fish. These city-ships might have been purpose-built for their task, or they could be jury-rigged conglomerations of ships and structures thrown together when the need for seagoing life become apparent to the locals.
enemies	Pirate city lord, Mer-human raider chieftain, Hostile landsman noble, Enemy city saboteur
friends	City navigator, Scout captain, Curious mer-human, Hard-pressed ship-city engineer
complications	The seas are not water, The fish schools have vanished and the city faces starvation, Terrible storms drive the city into the glacial regions, Suicide ships ram the cityâ€™s hull
things	Giant pearls with mysterious chemical properties, Buried treasure, Vital repair materials
places	Bridge of the city, Storm-tossed sea, A bridge fashioned of many small boats.

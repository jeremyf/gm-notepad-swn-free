tag	Dying Race
description	The inhabitants of this world are dying out, and they know it. Through environmental toxins, hostile bio-weapons, or sheer societal despair, the culture cannot replenish its numbers. Members seek meaning in their own strange goals or peculiar faiths, though a few might struggle to find some way to reverse their slow yet inevitable doom.
enemies	Hostile outsider who wants the locals dead, Offworlder seeking to take advantage of their weakened state, Invaders eager to push the locals out of their former lands
friends	One of the few youth among the population, Determined and hopeful reformer, Researcher seeking a new method of reproduction
complications	The dying culture’s values were monstrous, The race’s death is somehow necessary to prevent some grand catastrophe, The race is somehow convinced they deserve this fate
things	Extremely valuable reproductive tech, Treasured artifacts of the former age, Bioweapon used on the race
places	City streets devoid of pedestrians, Mighty edifice now crumbling with disrepair, Small dwelling full of people in a town now otherwise empty

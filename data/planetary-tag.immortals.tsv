tag	Immortals
description	Natives of this world are effectively immortal. They may have been gengineered for tremendous lifespans, or have found some local anagathic, or be cyborg life forms, or be so totally convinced of reincarnation that death is a cultural irrelevance. Any immortality technique is likely applicable only to them, or else it’s apt to be a massive draw to outside imperialists.
enemies	Outsider determined to steal immortality, Smug local convinced of their immortal wisdom to rule all, Offworlder seeking the world’s ruin before it becomes a threat to all
friends	Curious longevity researcher, Thrill-seeking local,
complications	Immortality requires doing something that outsiders can’t or won’t willingly do, The immortality ends if they leave the world, Death is the punishment for even minor crimes, Immortals must die or go offworld after a certain span, Immortality has brutal side-effects
things	Immortality drug, Masterwork of an ageless artisan, Toxin that only affects immortals
places	Community with no visible children, Unchanging structure of obvious ancient age, Cultural performance relying on a century of in-jokes

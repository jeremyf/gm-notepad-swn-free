tag	Holy War
description	A savage holy war is raging on this world, either between factions of locals or as a united effort against the pagans of some neighboring world. This war might involve a conventional religion, or it might be the result of a branding campaign, political ideology, artistic movement, or any other cause that people use as a substitute for traditional religion.
enemies	Blood-mad pontiff, Coldly cynical secular leader, Totalitarian political demagogue
friends	Desperate peacemaker, Hard-pressed refugee of the fighting, Peaceful religious leader who lost the internal debate
complications	The targets of the war really are doing something diabolically horrible, The holy war is just a mask for a very traditional casus belli, The leaders donâ€™t want the war won but only prolonged, Both this world and the target of the war are religion-obsessed
things	Sacred relic of the faith, A captured blasphemer under a death sentence, Plunder seized in battle
places	Massive holy structure, Razed community of infidels, Vast shrine to the martyrs dead in war

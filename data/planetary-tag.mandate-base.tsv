tag	Mandate Base
description	The Terran Mandate retained its control over this world for much longer than usual, and the world may still consider itself a true inheritor of Mandate legitimacy.

enemies	Deranged Mandate monitoring AI, Aspiring sector ruler, Demagogue preaching local superiority over “traitorous rebel worlds”.
friends	Idealistic do-gooder local, Missionary for advanced Mandate tech, Outsider seeking lost data from Mandate records
complications	The monitoring system forces the locals to behave in aggressive ways toward “rebel” worlds, The monitoring system severely hinders offworld use of their tech, The original colonists are all dead and have been replaced by outsiders who don’t understand all the details
things	Ultra-advanced pretech, Mandate military gear, Databank containing precious tech schematics
places	Faded Mandate offices still in use, Vault containing ancient pretech, Carefully-maintained monument to Mandate glory

tag	Cyclical Doom
description	The world regularly suffers some apocalyptic catastrophe that wipes out organized civilization on it. The local culture is aware of this cycle and has traditions to ensure a fragment of civilization survives into the next era, but these traditions don’t always work properly, and sometimes dangerous fragments of the past emerge.
enemies	Offworlder seeking to trigger the apocalypse early for profit, Local recklessly taking advantage of preparation stores, Demagogue claiming the cycle is merely a myth of the authorities
friends	Harried official working to prepare, Offworlder studying the cycles, Local threatened by perils of the cycle’s initial stages
complications	The cycles really are a myth of the authorities, The cycles are controlled by alien constructs, An outside power is interfering with preparation
things	A lost cache of ancient treasures, Tech or archives that will pinpoint the cycle’s timing, Keycodes to bypass an ancient vault’s security
places	Lethally-defended vault of forgotten secrets, Starport crowded with panicked refugees, Town existing in the shadow of some monstrous monument to a former upheaval

tag	Fallen Hegemon
description	At some point in the past, this world was a hegemonic power over some or all of the sector, thanks to superior tech, expert diplomacy, the weakness of their neighbors, or inherited Mandate legitimacy. Some kind of crash or revolt broke their power, however, and now the world is littered with the wreckage of former glory.
enemies	Bitter pretender to a meaningless throne, Resentful official dreaming of empire, Vengeful offworlder seeking to punish their old rulers
friends	Realistic local leader trying to hold things together, Scholar of past glories, Refugee from an overthrown colonial enclave
complications	The hegemon’s rule was enlightened and fair, It collapsed due to its own internal strife rather than external resistance, It pretends that nothing has happened to its power, It’s been counter-colonized by vengeful outsiders
things	Precious insignia of former rule, Relic tech important to its power, Plundered colonial artifact
places	Palace far too grand for its current occupant, Oversized spaceport now in disrepair, Boulevard lined with monuments to past glories
